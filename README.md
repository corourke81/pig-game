# PIG-GAME - game developed as part of online course by Jonas Schmedtmann

Two player game. First player to score 20 or higher wins. If a player rolls a 1, their turn is over and their total score remains unchanged. If a player does not roll a 1, number on die is added to current score. Player can hold at any time, and current score is added to total score for new total score. It is then the other player's turn. Player 1 always starts.
